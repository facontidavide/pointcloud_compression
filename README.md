# Experimental software to benchmark PCl compression

Currently working on a lossy compression for pointclouds generated by LIDARs.
Currently:

- It preserves the number of points and their order.
- No voxelization.
- Limitation: works only for `pcl::PointXYZI` (but can be easily extended to other types).

Work in progress. Nevertheless, **YOU** can help.

Run this app on an existing rosbag containing a `sensors_msgs/PointCloud2` message generated by a LIDAR.

In [Releases](https://github.com/facontidavide/pointcloud_compression/releases), you should find an AppImage that can run directly in Ubuntu 22.04.

First command line argument is the path to the rosbag.
