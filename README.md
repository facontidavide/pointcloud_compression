# Experimental software to benchmark PCl compression

Currently working on a lossy compression for pointclouds generated by LIDARs.
Currently:

- It preserves the number of points and their order.
- No voxelization.
- Limitation: works only for `pcl::PointXYZI` (but can be easily extended to other types).

Lossless ZSTD compression was added just for reference.

Work in progress. Nevertheless, **YOU** can help.

Run this app on an existing rosbag containing a `sensors_msgs/PointCloud2` message generated by a LIDAR.

In [Releases](https://github.com/facontidavide/pointcloud_compression/releases), you should find an AppImage that can run directly in Ubuntu 22.04.

First command line argument is the path to the rosbag.

Expected output (example):

```
Topic: /lidars/bpearl_back_left
  Count: 908
  Lossless Average time: 4163 usec
  Lossless Average ratio: 0.645825
  Lossy Average time: 2365 usec
  Lossy Average ratio: 0.319284
```
